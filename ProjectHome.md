The Erlang shell is a useful way to interact with the Erlang OS, but it can (with some extension) be a useful way to interact with the host OS as well.

The objective is to combine shell-like commands and idioms with Erlang idioms to produce something useful for certain situations (such as management of machines where an Erlang node is running but access is otherwise inconvenient) or to perform file maintenance tasks while within the Eshell.
